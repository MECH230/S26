Dear Students,

Here's our list of accomplishments of the week.

- We learned the Law of Balance of Linear Momentum (BoLM, Newton II, Euler I).
- We learned about the four steps needed to solve a problem using the BoLM.
- We learned that the 'equations of motion' of a system are scalar differential equations whose number is equal to the 'degrees of freedom' of the system.
- We introduced the 2D polar coordinate system and the 3D cylindrical polar coordinates.
- We practiced writing and projecting the BoLM vector equation even when different terms in the vector equations are written in different bases.

You are now able to solve up to sets 4 and 5 which are posted on the class website: https://mech230.github.io/S26/calendar/ Please solve these sets before next lecture, and pass by during office hours if you have any questions. You will have a related quiz during the problem session on Tuesday.

Plan for next week.

- Finish discussing the cylindrical polar coordinate system.
- Continue our discussion on degrees of freedom and constrained motion.
- Introduce the Serret-Frenet basis.

Remember that HW1, posted on Gradescope, is due on Monday January 26 at 6pm. Also, you are now able to complete HW2, also posted on Gradescope, which is due on Monday February 2 at 6pm.

PS. We have 2 more weeks to go before our first exam!

Wishing everyone a good weekend!

Best,

Theresa
