Dear Students,

Welcome to MECH230. We are looking forward to a smooth and productive semester!

Our first meeting will be during lecture tomorrow. Please note that you are required to attend all classes and exercise sessions, including the first class and first exercise session held on Tuesday January 13.

Also, kindly complete the following pre-semester checklist:

- Read the [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GPNKJ9yHqptAQO0rxhM3Yv_o8ANCDnAK/view?usp=sharing).
- Explore the course [website](https://mech230.github.io/S26/).
- Download the [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1209374) app on your phone, create an account, and login. Please let me know before tomorrow’s class if you haven’t received an email instructing you that you were enrolled in Gradescope.
- Note the exam dates listed in the syllabus and on the website homepage. Since this is a huge class (5 sections), we will not be changing the exam times.

Best Regards,<br>
MECH230 Teaching Team
