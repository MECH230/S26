Dear Students,

Here's our list of accomplishments of the week.

- We reviewed important concepts from Statics, namely FBDs, and vector calculus which were the subjects of quizzes 1 and 2 respectively.
- We started from general continuum mechanics and made a series of assumptions to narrow down the scope of the course.
- We introduced basic kinematics principles: position, velocity, and acceleration vectors and the arc-length scalar.
- We derived three scalar identities for the case of rectilinear motion.

You are now able to solve sets 1, 2, 3 which are posted on the class website: https://mech230.github.io/S26/calendar/ Please solve these sets before next lecture, and pass by during office hours if you have any questions.

Plan for next week.

- We will introduce the balance of linear momentum for a particle.
- We will introduce the cylindrical-polar coordinate system.

After Tuesday's lecture, you should be able to complete HW1, posted on Gradescope, which is due on Monday January 26 at 6pm.

PS. We have 3 more weeks to go before our first exam!

Wishing everyone a good weekend!

Best,

Theresa
