We will drop the 3 lowest quiz grades. This policy is intended to accommodate any potential absences during the semester. Please use this policy only as a last resort.

In accordance with departmental guidelines, the mean GPA for the course will be approximately in the B range. 

The exam solutions will be posted on the class website.

## In class quizzes
In this class, my goal is for you to get plenty of practice during lectures. To encourage this, most lectures will include either a group or an individual assessment.

## Homework
Each 1-2 weeks, you will have one homework assignment that involves some coding. The homework is to be done in groups of two or three. These assignments are designed to help you deeply understand and apply the concepts we cover in class. The assignments will be posted and submitted through Gradescope.

## Problem Sets
For each concept we cover, I will post a corresponding problem set. We will solve some of these problems in class, some during discussion sessions, and others will have video solutions. The remaining problems you are expected to work through on your own. You are always welcome to ask about any of these problems during office hours.

## Study Group
You are encouraged to form small study groups of 2-3 students. However, each student should write their homework on their own.
Do not share homework solutions!

## Text, Reader, and Supplemental Material
All of the lectures will be taken from Professor O’Reilly’s book

O. M. O’Reilly, Engineering Dynamics: A Primer, Third Edition
Springer-Verlag, New York, 2019.

The electronic version of this text is available for free through the AUB library website.

Problem set problems will be assigned from

J. L. Meriam, L. G. Kraige, and J. N. Bolton Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics, Ninth Edition, Wiley, New York, 2018.

You can use any version of this textbook as an extra reference. I will post the prompt of the questions you need to solve.

## Copyrights
All the course material, including but not limited to homework sets, homework solutions, quizzes, exams, lecture notes, lecture
videos, discussion notes, discussion videos, etc. are under copyright. No part can be copied transmitted (e.g. Chegg, course hero,
etc.), reproduced or translated into another language without the written permission of Theresa Honein.

## Honor Code
Cheating will not be tolerated. If you cheat, attempt to cheat, or fail to follow any of the teaching team's instructions during a quiz or exam, you will receive a zero on the assessment. If you cheat during an exam, you will fail the course and be reported to the MSFEA's disciplinary committee. There are no exceptions to this policy.

## Active Learning
Check out these two excellent videos of Professor Noel Perkins from the Univesity of Michigan at Ann Arbor explaining the active learning techniques he uses to teach dynamics! [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEys-JHeb8), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96j69u4v-wE). We will using these techniques ourselves.
